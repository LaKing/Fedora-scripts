Fedora-scripts
==============

Bash scripts for Fedora based systems.

- Wokstation installer can be used to add additional software automatically.
- ep_codepad installer is for Etherpad, optimised for code editing.
- srvctl can be used to controll lxc container creation and management.

The workstation installer is production-ready. I installed already 20-30 systems. If you notice something, please let me know.

The codepad project is under heavy construction. Not ready for production yet.

The srvctl script is also under construction. use it on your own risks. Versions change quick at this time of development, and there are no migration-scripts. If you use or plan to use this script you should contact me for support.
